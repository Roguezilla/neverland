# neverland
- What is neverland? neverland is a file hosting site which I first wrote to learn flask and later django by porting it from one framework to another.  
- Why is it called neverland? The name comes from one of my favorite mangas, ["The Promised Neverland"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Promised_Neverland).
- What can it do? Register accounts, login into accounts, upload and preview files.
